<div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my glorious position on the
<a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/user-committee">OpensStack User Committee</a>
(note to self submit bio for user committee page) I recently went
through all 619 free response comments collected by the
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/user-survey">user survey</a> in the past 12
months.  The point of that exercise was to come up with a very coarse
&ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; list to be presented with the tabulated survey results in
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-paris-summit-2014/">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things that kept coming up (though in the end finished out
of the money so no spoilers here) was making it easier to install
OpenStack.  Certainly this is an area though could use improvement,
but how much can it be improved and is it even OpenStack&rsquo;s business to
worry about installers?</p>

<p>When wearing my &lsquo;user committee&rsquo; hat I had to be neutral and try and
interpret the anonymous responses I was looking at as faithfully as
possible without any editorializing.  Well I&rsquo;m takin that hat off now
and putting on my more usual &lsquo;grumpy old bastard&rsquo; hat, so hold on kids
it&rsquo;s going to be a bumpy ride&hellip;</p>

<h2>You will never get a unicorn.</h2>

<p>Your package manager cannot help you here, <code>apt-get install openstack</code>
will never do what you want (nor will <code>yum install</code> or <code>emerge</code> or any
of the other variants Linux or otherwise).  There are simply too many
pieces and too many choices for this to ever really be practical, so
just get that idea out of your silly little head.</p>

<p>One of OpenStack&rsquo;s strength is it&rsquo;s flexibility and modularity. I&rsquo;m of
the opinion that this is the main reason it is currently dominant in
the private cloud space while more monolithic projects (ahem
<a href="https://www.eucalyptus.com/">Eucalyptus</a>) have all but faded
away. It&rsquo;s certainly why I threw away my Eucalyptus based cloud about
2 years ago, but I digress.</p>

<p>Flexibility necessarily brings some complexity. Now I think choice is
good, but perhaps you think things have gotten a bit out of
hand. Perhaps we have gone too far in the trade off between
flexibility and simplicity, but even if we could put that genie back
in the bottle divide the available options by 10 and you&rsquo;d still be
there all day long answering preinstall questions.</p>

<p>The main problem isn&rsquo;t even the millions of config options it&rsquo;s how
the setting those option affects what packages you need to install in
the first place. Which services will you provide? Keystone, Nova, and
Glance are pretty much required for an IaaS install (we&rsquo;ll assume a
different meta-package for a storage focused install what wouldn&rsquo;t
need those), but what about Cinder and if Cinder what storage backend?
Even with the most minimal (and somewhat unrealistic) IaaS
requirements, what hypervisor will you use, what storage will you use
for Glance these both have a big impact on what packages you
need. We&rsquo;ll wave hands over the Neutron options because those are just
crazy, but you do need to consider which RPC backend to use and I&rsquo;d
really like to see a choice of database backend as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But choice doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t have reasonable defaults&rdquo;, you say?
OK that&rsquo;s true. Suppose there&rsquo;s a magic package that makes all theses
choices and leave it to you to install by pieces if you want to make
different choices.</p>

<p>Well that unicorn isn&rsquo;t shooting rainbows out it&rsquo;s ass anymore, but
still a unicorn I&rsquo;ll grant. Here&rsquo;s the final kicker, OpenStack is
fundamentally a distributed system that can be decomposed in multiple
ways. Single controller, separate controller and network node are the
two most popular will there be separate Cinder nodes or will that be on
the controller?</p>

<p>Now maybe we can assume more defaults to simplify this, like a single
non HA controller that will do everything and we can add compute nodes
to talk to later. Well that isn&rsquo;t a unicorn anymore it&rsquo;s a toy. I&rsquo;ve
got nothing against playing with toys, they are useful for simple
testing and experimental learning.  If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for
you probably want a pony, I&rsquo;ll talk about those later.</p>

<h2>But I saw one over there.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;That last argument was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a> there are plenty of
ways to get my unicorn that don&rsquo;t rely on anything as crude as package
managers.&rdquo; Well that&rsquo;s true there are better ways to try and get your
unicorn, but I didn&rsquo;t make up that argument.  Someone actually wanted
to avoid &lsquo;kludging&rsquo; around with configuration management systems.</p>

<p>So yes can get better install automation by leveraging the
configuration management system of your choice.  In fact you&rsquo;re
a bit mad if you don&rsquo;t, but this is not a unicorn either it&rsquo;s just good
sense and takes a deep understanding of OpenStack to configure properly.
Perhaps less so than just installing raw as you can play a bit of
&ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; to get things going, but still somewhat less than
magical.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO">TripleO</a>? Yes, fine that may
be magical.  The OpenStack on OpenStack, OpenStack as a Service,
infinitely recursive, inceptiony thing may in fact have enough mojo to
do this in its perfected state. I haven&rsquo;t been following just how
close its current state is to this, but I will grant that it may grow
up to be a unicorn if it isn&rsquo;t already.</p>

<h2>You don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> want a unicorn anyway.</h2>

<p>Well not at first.</p>

<p>OpenStack in production is probably going to be a fairly important
part of your infrastructure. What is the point of a cloud if not to run
many more systems on the cloud than under it?</p>

<p>For something with your whole computational world riding on it, you
NEED to understand what the pieces are and how they are put together
in a very deliberate way. When something goes wrong you need to be
able to understand what is happening.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never met a piece of software that hasn&rsquo;t broken on me at some
point in some way. Software (and hardware for that matter) that is in
the critical path demands either a commercial support contract with a
very short response time or equivalent local expertise. Of course, being
local expertise, I prefer the latter there are plenty of people in the
ecosystem who will sell you the former as well.</p>

<p>Unicorns get you neither of these things.  If there were a silver
bullet, answer three questions and have a working OpenStack installer,
what would you do when something went wrong at 3am on a Saturday?</p>

<h2>Perhaps a pony then?</h2>

<p>Yes a pony would be nice.</p>

<h3>Toys for learning</h3>

<p>Being able to quickly setup a working OpenStack environment to
evaluate if it is worth looking into more deeply, is an entirely
reasonable goal.  As is getting a running cloud so you can learn how
it behaves through observing and deconstructing it.  Both of these are
a long way from production and can be expected to be done with little
to no OpenStack experience.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://fai-project.org/">FAI</a>, which we use for PXE bast boot
strapping around here, and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>to do the
actual OpenStack config bits for my first install (after an abortive
attempt at using <a href="https://maas.ubuntu.com/">MaaS</a> which conflicted
with too many existing services on my network).  Had a working multi
node proof of concept system up in less than 16 person hours from
deciding to hunt up abandoned hardware to having test users launching
VMs. Granted this was during the Essex release so pre-Neutron,
somewhat simpler times.</p>

<p>Today the official <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/">install guides</a> would
probably be both faster and better, since you can see the individual
pieces fitting together as you assemble them rather than first taking
a magical leap and then having to deconstruct what it did as it the
case with Puppet (or your tool of choice most likely).</p>

<p>Both these methods are a bit more time investment than one would
really want for the initial
evaluation. <a href="http://devstack.org/">DevStack</a> will get something
quickly with out too much investment, but as a developer tool it&rsquo;s not
quite an ideal operator evaluation tool. An introductory level unicorn
would be a good creature to have, so long as people understand it&rsquo;s
mythical nature and don&rsquo;t try to ride it all the way into production.</p>

<h3>Making a plan</h3>

<p>Even a pony can&rsquo;t help you here.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve come to understand the basics of how OpenStack is put
together in the basic sense from the above {de,re}construction, it&rsquo;s
time to find the union of what you want with what you can have an hope
that it includes what you need (it probably will).</p>

<p>The only way to do this is to do it. Iterate through configs either by
hand or preferably through your config engine until you get what you
want.</p>

<p>Only <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/">Docs</a> can help you here.  Now the
docs team works amazing hours and does great work, but keeping up
with the pace of OpenStack is near impossible.  If you find something
confusing, outdated, or just plain wrong there&rsquo;s a little red bug icon
on the top right of every page, click that and report it.</p>

<p>Ultimately in our perfectly documented world this iteration is still
necessary if only to prove the behavior described is actually what
you want.</p>

<h3>Executing the plan</h3>

<p>Once the hard design work is done you just feed that into your
existing configuration management system like you&rsquo;ve been doing for
all you server configs for years right?</p>

<p>Pretty much yes. Different tool communities have different bumps in
their particular processes, but if you pick the devil that you know
you can pretty much anticipate what those are</p>

<h2>So how is this OpenStack&rsquo;s business.</h2>

<p>Well in my opinion it&rsquo;s not really.</p>

<p>In a broad sense reducing over all complexity to the extent we can
and choosing reasonable defaults so fewer of the myriad config options
need to be set are good goals that are in scope and would help
simplify installs, but that&rsquo;s really a side effect, simplifying on
going management is the main need for those. You install infrequently
(maybe once) but systems management is forever.</p>

<p>Packaging is your distro&rsquo;s business which is as it should be, for
example when have you ever tried to install <a href="http://www.x.org">X</a> from
upstream or install
<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</a>? These are
instructive experiences but you probably wouldn&rsquo;t base you
infrastructure on do that. Of course if you are deploying from trunk
then you don&rsquo;t need packages, but you do need a CI/CD team and have
more complex problems than any dreamed of here.</p>

<p>Configuration management is the union of the OpenStack and tool
communities. You&rsquo;ll see sessions for various tools at
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit">Summits</a>, midcycle OPS meetups, and
on <a href="https://github.com/stackforg">StackForge</a>, but they are not
properly OpenStack projects.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re of course free to disagree, and build a native magical
installer if you want.  As I said choice is good. But if you&rsquo;re going
to hate on how hard OpenStack is to install try and remember what it
was like to install a GNU/Linux operating system when it was four
years old (say 1997 when the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> disto
was 4). OpenStack is a dream compared to that, so quit whining and get
to <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute">work</a>.</p>
